## Project overview
For my capstone project, I've combined various data sources from Spotify to answer four key questions around hit songs. The questions are:


1. How do the musical characteristics of hit songs — including duration, explicit language, tempo, and danceability — differ when compared to all songs on Spotify?

2. Does this vary by country, or are the differences between pop songs and other songs universal across the world?

3. Which countries tend to be the first places where global hits will appear on their charts, and which countries tend to trail behind?

4. Which musical artists have had the biggest impact on the artists who are currently topping the charts?

 #### How to run
To run the full pipeline, one simply needs to navigate to the `/src` directory in their terminal and run the command :
```
$ bash full_pipeline.sh
```
